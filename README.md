# MNIST Dataset Project

## About

The MNIST dataset is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The dataset is widely used in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. The images are grayscale and 28x28 pixels in size.
The dataset also includes labels for each image, telling us which digit it is.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify the handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset.

## Methodology

The project will be divided into the following steps:

1. Introduction
    - About the MNIST dataset
    - Objective of the project
2. Data Preprocessing
    - Load the dataset
    - Explore the dataset
    - Preprocess the dataset
3. Model Building
    - Build a machine learning model
    - Train the model
    - Evaluate the model
4. Conclusion
    - Summary of the project
    - Final thoughts

## Tools

The following tools will be used in this project:

- Language: Python
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- Environment: Jupyter Notebook
- Version Control: Git, GitHub
- IDE: PyCharm
- OS : Ubuntu 22.04
